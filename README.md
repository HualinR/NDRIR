# NDRIR: CGAN-BASED DIRECTIONAL ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSE GENERATOR
This is the official implementation of a directional room impulse response (DRIR) generator based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), termed Neural DRIR (NDRIR). The audio examples of the generated RIRs convolved with sound sources are available in the folder **Listening test audio examples**.

The trained networks are available [here]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJwdrQNVXQqlzCEToFtaOJer-IyKo8jx?usp=sharing)https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJwdrQNVXQqlzCEToFtaOJer-IyKo8jx?usp=sharing)
