# NDRIR: CGAN-BASED DIRECTIONAL ROOM IMPULSE RESPONSE GENERATOR
This is the official implementation of a directional room impulse response (DRIR) generator based on a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), termed Neural DRIR (NDRIR). 

The **audio examples** of the generated DRIRs convolved with sound sources are available in the folder [**Listening test examples**](https://github.com/HualinR/NDRIR/tree/main/Listening%20test%20examples).

The **trained networks** are available [**HERE**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SJwdrQNVXQqlzCEToFtaOJer-IyKo8jx?usp=sharing)
